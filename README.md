# angstrom-cpu

A 4-bit accumulator-based CPU designed to do the bare minimum and nothing more. 

I wanted to have a barebones architecture that I could physically build in
a weekend and COULD also implement in games such as Satisfactory, Minecraft, Rust, etc.

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

## Build

Build and test a Verilog module - `./build.sh mod`
